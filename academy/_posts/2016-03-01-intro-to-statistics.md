  In this two-part introductory statistics course, participants will learn the
  building blocks necessary to understand the data they work with and conduct
  more advanced analyses in the future. Topics covered in the first session
  include: statistical terminology, introduction to sampling, summarizing data
  through central tendency measures, understanding data variability measures,
  and examining distributions of data. 


  The second session will build on this content, with topics covering:
  introduction to probabilities, how to tell if statistics are meaningfully
  different from one-another, and how to make inferences about populations using
  samples. 


  It is expected that learners commit to attending both sessions.
