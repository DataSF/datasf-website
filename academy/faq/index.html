            <h1>HOW TO REGISTER</h1>
            <h2>Who can attend Data Academy trainings?</h2>
            <p>Data Academy trainings are free and are only available to employees of the City &amp; County of San Francisco with a valid DSW#. &nbsp;Please make sure to get your supervisor&rsquo;s approval before signing up to attend!</p>
            <h2>Do you have a calendar where I can view upcoming trainings?</h2>
            <p>Yes! You can find it at <a href="https://datasf.org/academy/calendar/" target="_blank">https://datasf.org/academy/calendar/</a>.</p>
            <h2>How do I sign up to be notified when future trainings are open for registration?</h2>
            <p>On the Data Academy website (<a href="https://datasf.org/academy/" target="_blank">https://datasf.org/academy/</a>) you will find our full course catalog. &nbsp;Click on the course you are interested in taking.&nbsp; On the right side of each individual course page, select the green button &ldquo;<em>Notify me when course is scheduled</em>&rdquo;. Fill in your contact information, and you&rsquo;re good to go!</p>
            <h2>I signed up to be notified when future trainings are open for registration, but I&rsquo;m not getting any emails! What&rsquo;s going on?</h2>
            <p>If you have signed up to receive course announcements and but haven&rsquo;t been getting emails, one of a few things might be happening! We might not have offered it since you signed up to receive notifications, OR you may fall into one of these two categories, in which case you won&rsquo;t get the notification of signups:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Already taken the class</li>
              <li>Previously signed up for the class but not attended</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you have questions, feel free to reach out at <a href="mailto:DataAcademy@sfgov.org?subject=Signing%20Up%20for%20DA%20Classes">DataAcademy@sfgov.org</a>.</p>
            <h2>How do I register for a training?</h2>
            <p>Roughly three weeks before a training, we send a course announcement to the class&rsquo; notification list with a sign-up link for the course (see &ldquo;<em>How do I sign up to be notified</em>&rdquo; for instructions to join the list). Simply fill out the Google form included in the announcement email with the required information, and your spot is reserved!</p>
            <p><u>TIP:</u> Seats are reserved on a first-come, first-served basis and fill up quickly. Therefore, we recommend getting your supervisor&rsquo;s approval to take a Data Academy class ahead of time so that you can sign up when you see the email.</p>
            <p><u>Please note:</u> Demand for classes is very high, so we ask that you not register for a class unless you are sure you can attend. Per our standard process, anyone who registers for a class is removed from the notification list even if you later decide to not attend.&nbsp; Please consult our calendar to make sure you are available for the course you are interested in taking before signing up.</p>
            <h1>I AM HAVING TROUBLE REGISTERING FOR A CLASS</h1>
            <h2>I wanted to register for a training, but it filled up before I had a chance! &nbsp;What do I do?</h2>
            <p>We&rsquo;re very sorry that you weren&rsquo;t able to get a spot this time around! We are trying to increase our capacity to offer more classes, but in the meantime make sure you&rsquo;re on the notification list and ready to sign up next time the class is offered. Remember that we generally send out the registration link ~3 weeks before a class is offered, so check out our <a target="_blank" href="https://datasf.org/academy/calendar/">calendar</a> to keep an eye out for the next one!</p>
            <h2>I am interested in a training that has just been announced, but I can&rsquo;t go this time. &nbsp;What do I do?</h2>
            <p>We try to offer classes as often as possible &ndash; make sure you&rsquo;re on the notification list so you can sign up next time the class is held!</p>
            <h2>How do I cancel my registration?</h2>
            <p>We ask that you do your best to attend any class you sign up for and avoid allowing conflicts to arise. However, we know that sometimes things come up and you will have to cancel your reservation.</p>
            <p>When you register for a class, you will receive a confirmation email and be added to an Outlook calendar event. If you must cancel your reservation, please decline the calendar event.</p>
            <p><u>Please note:</u> Everyone who registers for the class will be removed from the notification list, even if you don&rsquo;t attend and provide advanced notice.</p>
            <h2>My schedule tends to fill up a few weeks in advance. Can you send out training announcements earlier?</h2>
            <p>We send out class registration approximately three weeks before the class date, because we have found that opening sign-ups earlier than that leads to more cancellations as the date approaches.</p>
