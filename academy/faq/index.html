            <h2>Who can attend Data Academy trainings?</h2>
            <p>Data Academy trainings are free and are only available to employees of the City &amp; County of San Francisco. &nbsp;Please make sure to get your supervisor&rsquo;s approval before signing up to attend!</p>
            <h2>How do I sign up for a training?</h2>
            <p>Roughly three weeks before a training, we send a course announcement to the class&rsquo; notification list with a sign-up link for the course (see &ldquo;How do I sign up to be notified&rdquo; for instructions to join the list). Simply fill out the Google form included in the announcement email with the required information, and your spot is reserved!</p>
            <p>Seats are reserved on a first-come, first-served basis and fill up quickly. Therefore, we recommend getting your supervisor&rsquo;s approval to take a Data Academy class ahead of time so that you can sign up when you see the email.</p>
            <p><u>Please note:</u> Demand for classes is very high, so we ask that you not register for a class unless you are sure you can attend. Per our standard process, anyone who registers for a class is removed from the notification list even if you later decide to not attend.</p>
            <h2>How do I sign up to be notified when new trainings are open for registration?</h2>
            <p>On the Data Academy website (<a href="https://datasf.org/academy/" target="_blank">https://datasf.org/academy/</a>) you will find our full course catalogue. On the right side of each individual course page, select the button &ldquo;Join the notification list for this course&rdquo;.</p>
            <p>If you have signed up to receive these course announcements and do not fall into either of the following categories, you will receive the notification the next time it is sent out!</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Already taken the class</li>
              <li>Previously signed up for the class but not attended</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>I wanted to sign up for a training, but it filled up before I had a chance! What do I do?</h2>
            <p>We&rsquo;re very sorry that you weren&rsquo;t able to get a spot this time around! We are trying to increase our capacity to offer more classes, but in the meantime make sure you&rsquo;re on the notification list and ready to sign up next time the class is offered.</p>
            <h2>I am interested in a training that has just been announced, but I can&rsquo;t go this time. What do I do?</h2>
            <p>We try to offer classes as often as possible &ndash; make sure you&rsquo;re on the notification list so you can sign up next time the class is held!</p>
            <h2>How do I cancel my registration?</h2>
            <p>We ask that you do your best to attend any class you sign up for and avoid allowing conflicts to arise. However, we know that sometimes things come up and you will have to cancel your reservation.</p>
            <p>When you register for a class, you will receive a confirmation email and be added to an Outlook calendar event. If you must cancel your reservation, please decline the calendar event.</p>
            <p><u>Please note:</u> Everyone who registers for the class will be removed from the notification list, even if you don&rsquo;t attend and provide advanced notice.</p>
            <h2>My schedule tends to fill up a few weeks in advance. Can you send out training announcements earlier?</h2>
            <p>We send out class registration approximately three weeks before the class date, because we have found that opening sign-ups earlier than that leads to more cancellations as the date approaches.</p>
            <h2>Do you have a calendar where I can view upcoming trainings?</h2>
            <p>Yes! You can find it at <a href="https://datasf.org/academy/calendar/" target="_blank">https://datasf.org/academy/calendar/</a>. Please note that you cannot sign up for the classes through the calendar &ndash; make sure you&rsquo;re on the class notification list so that you are alerted when signups open!</p>
            <h2>I heard you guys offer customized, department‐specific trainings! Could you do one for my department?</h2>
            <p>We do occasionally offer custom trainings, please contact <a href="mailto:DataAcademy@sfgov.org?subject=Customized%20Training">DataAcademy@sfgov.org</a> for more information.</p>
            <h2>My team/ division/ department would like to partner with Data Academy to offer private courses at our own location &ndash; who should I talk to about setting this up?</h2>
            <p>We&rsquo;d love to help you build the skills of your team and make training as accessible as possible &ndash; email us at <a href="mailto:DataAcademy@sfgov.org?subject=Department%20Partnership">DataAcademy@sfgov.org</a> and let&rsquo;s see what we can do!</p>
            <h2>Where can I find course materials?</h2>
            <p>Every course page on the Data Academy website (<a href="https://datasf.org/academy/" target="_blank">https://datasf.org/academy/</a>) has a link on the right side of the page called &ldquo;View course materials&rdquo;. This will take you to a Google Drive folder, where you can find the materials used for that class.</p>
            <h2>I am a City employee and I want to teach a Data Academy course! Can I?</h2>
            <p>Let&rsquo;s talk! Email us at <a href="mailto:DataAcademy@sfgov.org?subject=Teaching%20with%20Data%20Academy">DataAcademy@sfgov.org</a>.</p>
            <h2>I heard that the Controller&rsquo;s Office could help subsidize up‐front costs associated with acquiring a Tableau Desktop license. &nbsp;How does that work?</h2>
            <p>The Controller&rsquo;s Office will subsidize City departments for the up‐front costs associated with acquiring one initial Tableau Desktop license and the first year of support (approximately $2,000 as of 6/16/2015). &nbsp;Departments are responsible for paying ongoing support on their own (approximately $400 a year as of 6/16/20151 ). &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Please contact <a href="mailto:sherman.luk@sfgov.org?subject=Tableau%20License">sherman.luk@sfgov.org</a> for more information about how to acquire a Tableau Desktop license with the Controller&rsquo;s initial support.</p>
