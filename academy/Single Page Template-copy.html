          <h1>Office Hours</h1>
          <p>We know that sometimes coming to a full Data Academy class won't make sense for you. You might have just one specific question about a program you're using, and don't have the time or the need to come to a full course. Instead, you just need a little guidance about how to solve the challenge you've run into, so you can get back to work!&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Data Academy can help you here, too. With our deep roster of talented instructors, we are offering Office Hours for all of the skills listed on this page. Just follow the instructions to sign up for a time slot, then sit down for a 1-on-1 session to work through the roadblock you're having trouble with.</p>
          <p>Come prepared to learn in these sessions, the instructor won't be doing the work for you, but you'll talk through the process and skills you need in order to solve the issue yourself.</p>
          <p>See you soon at office hours!</p>
          <h2>Excel</h2>
          <p>Are you having a specific problem in Excel, don't understand a formula in one of your worksheets, or think Excel could help you in your work but aren't quite sure how? Sign up for a 1-hour Excel Office Hours session with Data Academy!</p>

            <li>Creating or understanding specific formulas</li>
            <li>Creating dashboards to summarize and report on data</li>
            <li>Organizing data to improve workflows</li>
            <li>Cleaning and improving readability of data</li>
          </ul>
