Sponsored by SFGIS, this course consists of five 3-hour sessions. Course content moves quickly through the basics of ArcGIS Pro before diving into more advanced topics in later sessions. A prior basic understanding of ArcGIS Pro is helpful due to the fast-paced nature of the class, but is not necessary if you are willing to work hard!
