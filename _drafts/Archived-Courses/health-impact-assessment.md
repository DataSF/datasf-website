title: Health Impact Assessment
description: "Because much of what influences health happens outside of the doctor’s office, local health departments analyze a multitude of decisions that have the greatest potential to improve or harm health. \_The San Francisco Department of Public Health plays a central role in factoring health into many local policies, plans, and programs, such as our transportation network, economic development projects, labor standards and climate change initiatives. This activity-based training will discuss different types of strategies and evidence-based tools used by health impact assessments that all analysts and managers can use to conduct a data analysis project from start to finish and determine whether a policy or plan will promote, enhance, or discourage health and equity."
