Jenessa works on the operational and financial processes that support the City Performance Unit. Her project portfolio has ranged from performance measurement, facilitation, and Lean. As a member of the City Performance Lean Team, Jenessa has helped to develop the curriculum for training City employees on Lean process improvement, and enjoys empowering line staff to make incremental, powerful changes to their daily work. She hopes the Lean Team can create a culture within City government for continuous improvement, and that all City employees feel ownership and pride for the work they do every day.
