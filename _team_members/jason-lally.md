Jason Lally is the Data Services Manager, working with the City’s Chief Data Officer, Joy Bonaguro, to help operationalize the City’s data strategy. Jason comes to the City by way of a Mayor’s Innovation Fellowship that wrapped up in August 2014. Before that, he worked at the intersection of technology and urban planning as Director of the Decision Lab at PlaceMatters in Denver, CO. He came to open government and open data through his work in cities and regions across the country on data-informed, community planning processes. Recognizing a need for more robust information services and platforms to support strong community engagement, Jason is pleased to contribute to making data more accessible and useful at the City. Jason earned his Masters in City and Regional Planning from the University of Pennsylvania.
