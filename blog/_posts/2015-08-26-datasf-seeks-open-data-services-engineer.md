Our users are diverse and varied and come from inside and outside the organization; willingness to take time to learn their needs and perspective is a needed trait.

 - Familiar with the concepts of open data
 - Comfort creating, following, standardizing, and automating business processes to support program management
 - 3+ years experience in related work
 - BS/BA in GIS, computer science, engineering, user-centered design or related field

## Skills we prefer
We would love applicants who also meet the following:

 - Passionate about improving government through open data
 - Enthusiastic about empowering use of data, with a focus on mapping, within and without the City
 - Advanced experience with front end development
 - Experience with back end development and database management
