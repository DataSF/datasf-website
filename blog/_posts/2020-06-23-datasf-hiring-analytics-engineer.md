Since March the city has been rapidly responding to COVID-19. DataSF played and continues to play a key role in helping the City rapidly bring together crucial COVID related data for internal operational and external transparency and communications needs. We are extremely proud of the results so far with countless internal operational dashboards and the [public reporting work](https://datasf.org/covid19) spearheaded by DataSF, the [Controller's Office City Performance Unit](https://sfcontroller.org/city-performance), and the [Department of Public Health](https://www.sfdph.org/dph/default.asp).

[And we want you to join the response](/join-us/).

## We need you for the COVID response and beyond\!

As an **Analytics Engineer** you will join this important effort to help construct data pipelines to make sure the right data is in the hands of the right decision-makers at the right time. You will leverage our internal infrastructure (Snowflake, DBT, Safe FME, and the Socrata data platform) to help DataSF grow and refine the data architecture supporting the COVID response.

But this position will be involved in more data domains than the COVID response. Your talents and skills will be brought to bear on such crucial issues such as housing, criminal justice reform, clean streets, and the built environment. Like the COVID response each of these domains requires data from different sources to be brought together, standardized and made meaningful for operational and strategic analysis.

## Technical skills, empathy, and your own life experience needed for this job

DataSF knows from experience this type of work is most successfully tackled not solely based on engineering skills (though they are important), but people skills as well. You will lean as much on your empathy as your coding skills. You are not merely handed a spec but are involved in the interactive and agile client engagement process to bring meaning, analytics, and empathy to the real challenges facing our city.

You will also need to be able to think beyond the walls of City Hall to understand and hold in mind the diverse array of experiences embodied in the San Francisco residents you serve. DataSF does not allow its data work to exist in a vacuum. We constantly apply an ethical lens to data use to protect the most vulnerable. Your own life experience is a critical contribution to this effort. DataSF is committed to building a team whose diversity reflects the residents we serve.

You won’t be doing this alone. At DataSF you will be supported by a collaborative team that loves forging new ground to create processes and structure in cross-cutting data domains where none may exist. We find this keeps the work both exciting and new (always a new problem with new data\!) but sustainable (we stay sane and healthy by [developing](/blog/part-1-datasfs-operating-manual-for-open-data/) [programs](/blog/part-1-how-to-solicit-and-select-data-science-projects/) [and](/blog/4-steps-to-manage-privacy-and-de-identification-for-your-open-data-program/) [processes](/blog/how-to-ensure-quality-data/) to [help](/blog/4-steps-to-manage-security-risks-with-open-data/) [manage](/blog/5-ways-to-scale-mountain-of-data/) it all, which cities across the world have used).

Please review (and share\!) the [full job description](/join-us/). We look forward to your application.
