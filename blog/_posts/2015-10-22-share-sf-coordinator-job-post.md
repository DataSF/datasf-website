The City and County of San Francisco is seeking a talented individual to play a transformational role in local government by helping to ensure that we are able to successfully, sustainably, and respectably navigate the data sharing space.

Social service delivery is in the midst of a migration from program to people centric care. Our most vulnerable individuals touch multiple systems - education, human services, and criminal justice - which have historically operated in silos. The transition to coordinated care will tailor services to meet the needs of each individual, rather than administering programs with a one-size-fits-all approach.

A coordinated care approach is best carried out when multiple agencies and jurisdictions are able to share data about the individuals they are jointly serving, so that efforts are not duplicated, and the dosage of services is based on the right mix of supports. Effective data sharing is at the heart of coordinated care and this role will support that work.

## The Job
The ShareSF Coordinator will develop and shepherd the City’s work on cross-department and cross-jurisdictional data sharing. Reporting directly to the Chief Data Officer and working closely with the Controller’s office, the ShareSF Coordinator will be responsible for developing a program to support repeatable, scalable, legal, and respectful means for sharing regulated data. Ultimately, this role will play a key and central role to maturing the City’s capacity to effectively leverage data in decision-making via case management, evaluation and planning so that residents can experience services that are more effective, holistic, and integrated.

The responsibilities for the role will include but not be limited to:

 - Develop and continuously improve data sharing policies and procedures for cross-department use
 - Develop strategies to support cross-department or citywide approaches to achieve effective data sharing, e.g. a city consent strategy
 - Conduct legal and privacy analysis and develop recommendations for data sharing questions and use cases
 - Develop enduring knowledge materials to support effective decision-making for data sharing, e.g. MOU templates, data use sharing agreements, training and decision trees
 - Develop and oversee knowledge repository on data sharing issues to preserve institutional memory and ensure consistent application
 - Help develop or inform legislative agenda as needed for local, state and federal levels 
 - Advise on requirements for technical infrastructure or tools to support data sharing
 - Liaison with policy and program leaders within and without the City, including Data Sharing Committee members and their respective departments, to ensure that the program is supporting ongoing and emerging needs
 - Keep abreast of the latest developments in practices, regulation and laws related to data sharing

## What We're Looking Forgot

### At a minimum
 - A Master's degree from an accredited college or university, preferably in public policy, law, public administration, business, or equivalent.
 - Three (3) years of verifiable and recent experience in one or more of the following: public policy, public administration, law, privacy, management, consulting, or policy analysis.
 - The full job posting lists some alternatives to these minimums

### We would love
 - A JD/MPP or an extensive background in legal or privacy work
 - Project management experience
 - Experience working for local government and/or public management
 - Familiarity with privacy and data sharing laws, including state and federal laws such as HIPAA and FERPA
