*Data and Analytical Transparency with PowerBI and Open Data*

## Background

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is in everyone’s best interest. &nbsp;SF Environment is ensuring everyone in San Francisco plays their part via programs, outreach, and community engagement. &nbsp;Yet, while everyone plays a role, in San Francisco, 45% of greenhouse gas emissions come from buildings.&nbsp;<br>In 2011, the Existing Commercial Buildings Energy Performance Ordinance was passed to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in this vital sector. As specified in the ordinance, each year building owners are required to report data to the Department for benchmarking purposes. &nbsp;SF Environment uses this data to engage in targeted outreach and collaborates with building owners to reduce energy use.

## What was the problem

For SF Environment, transparency is paramount. &nbsp;The ordinance requires public disclosure of the data submitted. SF Environment fulfilled this by publishing [the dataset](https://data.sfgov.org/Energy-and-Environment/Existing-Commercial-Buildings-Energy-Performance-O/j2j3-acqj) on the open data portal. &nbsp; Additionally, they &nbsp;commissioned an annual report on the dataset. &nbsp;Through this work, they matched the transparency efforts of the 20 other peer cities with similar legislation.<br>![](/uploads/env-raw-data.png){: width="602" height="353"}

However, &nbsp;SF Environment was not satisfied. &nbsp; There were public as well as internal friction points. &nbsp;SF Environment wanted not just transparency, but engagement. The public report, though well designed, was 30 pages long and static. &nbsp;They did not feel it conveyed the purpose of the ordinance in an engaging way to affected buildings.. Internally, they frequently needed to analyze the data beyond what was provided in the annual reports for in-house planning and to respond to policy makers’ requests. &nbsp;This cost staff time and was an ongoing analytic burden.

SF Environment needed an interactive, up-to-date report that would be scalable and modifiable to meet ongoing analytic requests.

## What was done

SF Environment settled on PowerBI as the tool to build the report. &nbsp;Primary drivers of this choice was PowerBI’s ability to automate the ‘data wrangling’ portion of the project and its flexibility to serve both internal and external audience needs.<br>After attending a DataSF training session, SF Environment rapidly built out the interactive report. &nbsp;They pulled key messages and visuals from the annual report, but ,most importantly, the SF Environment’s analyst, Ammon Reagan, saw this as an opportunity to step back and design something that could meet the needs of different constituent groups. He developed new charts, pages, and interactions to satisfy needs not met by the existing annual report. &nbsp;

The final report [was launched on March 2019.](https://sfenvironment.org/energy/san-francisco-existing-buildings-performance-report)<br>&nbsp;

## What was the outcome

San Francisco is now the first city to create a public interactive report of Building Energy Use in the United States. &nbsp;Residents, building owners, or policy makers who use the report are able to understand why the ordinance exists, current state of energy usage, and track the performance of San Francisco in reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.<br>![](/uploads/env-1-report.png){: width="659" height="343"}

Furthermore, SF Environment internally uses the same report to shape targeted outreach and ongoing business community engagement. &nbsp;SF Environment has noted a monthly reduction in staff hours spent on processing and re-analyzing the data &nbsp;thanks to the online report. Tasks that traditionally may have been contracted out are being done in-house with &nbsp;PowerBI. &nbsp;But most importantly, all parties – from residents to businesses to policy makers – &nbsp;not only have access to the same data, but to &nbsp;the same analytical tool as well. &nbsp;Full stack transparency\!
